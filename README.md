# AI-Based-Recommendation-System-for-Preventive-Healthcare-
Problem Statement:
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often overlook early signs of health issues due to a lack of accessible and personalized preventive healthcare tools. Traditional diagnostic methods primarily focus on treating diseases rather than preventing them, and they often require clinical visits, making early intervention difficult. There is a growing need for a user-friendly, AI-driven solution that can provide timely, personalized health recommendations—such as diet, workouts, and precautions— based on early symptom input, thereby enabling proactive health management and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
